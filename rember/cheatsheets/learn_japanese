# A compilation of resources and techniques for learning Japanese
+ Thanks to modern AI, it should be easier than ever to get advice and clarifications when needed (though some things are still a matter of culture, which only real humans would know)
+ Using the language is generally great; you can do that by having a pen-pal (anyone you could talk to on the internet), watching Japanese videos, playing Japanese games, reading manga





>> Tools and Apps
+ Remember that some very convenient tools are plain browser "extensions"/"plugins"/"add-ons"
* Anki - memorization cards, sorted into various categories and adapted for the user
*   AnkiDroid - Anki on Android
* Migaku - paid service that uses Anki
* Duolingo - a paid/commercials language-learning app that teaches basic sentences and common words
