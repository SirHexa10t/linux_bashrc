# Reminders for relevant specs and priorities when buying computer hardware


+ A notice about units in this page (skip this if you're short on time)
+ Wherever mentioned in this page, "B" refers to "byte" (8 bits) and "b" refers to "bit". In no place should 'B' be used to signify "bit".
+ Decimal vs Binary units:
+   "KB"/"MB"/"GB"/"TB"/"PB"/"EB"/"ZB"        refer to decimal thousands  (10^3x); kilo is 1000 , mega is 1,000,000 , giga is 1,000,000,000 , tera is 1,000,000,000,000 , and so on.
+   "KiB"/"MiB"/"GiB"/"TiB"/"PiB"/"EiB"/"ZiB" refer to binary "thousands" (2^10x); kibi is 1024 , mebi is 1,048,576 , gibi is 1,073,741,824 , tebi is 1,099,511,627,776 , and so on.
+       People are generally confused about these and often mention "KB"/"MB"/"GB"/"TB" when they mean "KiB"/"MiB"/"GiB"/"TiB" (Thanks, Microstoft. For starting this. STILL persisting with the wrong notation to this day!)
+       As you can see, almost exactly 10% of your X-TB SSD's space would be "gone" because they promise in decimal, but your OS shows in binary
+           If you're curious about it, the "error" is almost 21% difference between the binary "Yobi" (2^80) and decimal "Yotta" (1000^8, i.e. e24, a "Tera Tera")
*           The difference reaches 100% (decimal's is less than half of binary's) where 1024^x/1000^x = 1.024^x > 2 ; so at x=30. The internet is sized at order of magnitude of 100 Zetabytes, not even 1 Yottabyte (where x=8)



>> Desktop PC requirements

> Components
* A standard desktop computer should includes the following:
*   Motherboard
*   CPU
*   CPU cooler
*   GPU (usually comes with air-cooled heatsink, rarely with AIO or water-block)
*       If you don't need a strong GPU, a CPU's integrated graphics unit (APU) should be fine as a replacement; if you need that, make sure to get a CPU that has it.
*   RAM
*   Disk (could/should be SSD)
*   PSU
*   Case
+   Also cables, like DP/HDMI for monitor, or SATA cables for SATA devices

> Cross-compatibility
* The motherboard and the CPU need to fit each-other; it's a factor of generation and CPU-maker
* Anything else is cross-compatible. Even GPU; any would go along with your build - you can put an NVIDIA card on an AMD motherboard 

> Budgeting
* Use case: consider that a lot of things aren't cost-effective a lower prices, or only cost-effective at very-low prices (but unsatisfactory performance)
*   Need something, right now: look for deals on ebay and get slower disk, weaker GPU. You can make-do without most of the features that turn parts expensive (and could get those in 2 years realatively cheap)
*   Plan to use long-term: if you want to save money by not buying a new PC more often, consider what you need and buy by parts' value retention. Usually it means buying almost-highest-end.
*       The things that don't improve exponentially over time (coolers/PSU/case) should be bought "right" from the start, so you won't need to re-buy them at all.
*       It's a generally good strategy. You'll also enjoy higher-than-average performance until your next upgrade. 
* For a gaming/heavy-workload PC, your GPU should cost about 1/3 of the total build
* If you're looking for ultra-budget;
*   A media mini-PC (a box that comes with motherboard and CPU (usually with APU) pre-installed) would cost 150-500 dollars (varying by hardware and purpose, mostly an extra expense on disk(s)).
*   A micro-ATX small-form PC (just 2 slots of RAM, 1 slot for GPU, small case) would get most of what you want done. Would cost around 500-1000 dollars.

> Building aids
* TODO - Thermal paste (or liquid metal)
* TODO - screwdriver

> Optional upgrades
* PCIe cards that do a better job than your motherboard:
*   audio card
*   networking (NIC)
*       You might want to output the audio through digital (binary) signals like USB, or optical: TosLink (Toshiba Link) or S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface)
*   more USB ports
*   WiFi
* You can do liquid-cooling (not for beginners) and forego some of the air-coolers (a guide for that is in a separate page)



>> General Knowledge

> Advice on buying
* PC hardware Prices are generally best around the end of the year, by Black Friday, and towards the holidays (Christmas, New Years...)
* CPU / GPU announcements and launches are around Q3, which factors into price-drops by the end of the year (especially of year beginning's leading-edge hardware)
* There's a "best-tax"; you pay extra for buying the best, just because there's nothing better to compete with it. So it often makes sense to buy 2nd-best thing. A previous series rather than current, or 2nd best card in the recent series...
* Try to buy from a shop that has good refund/return policy, in case you get a defective product (NewEgg is problematic at that regard)

> Bottlenecks
* In any system, the slowest component slows down the whole chain. So make sure that the components are around parity in terms of throughput
*   Example: a relatively weak GPU in a system with a powerful CPU (the result is low-FPS; images won't be rendered at a fast pace though the information gets passed to it fast enough)
*   Example: CPU waits for longer periods of time to receive a response from some low-quality RAM
* When accruing heat, PC components slow down in order to maintain some work, but not overheat/burn
*   Often caused by poor ventilation issues: lousy heatsinks, blockage of air-intakes to of the case, accumulation of dust, and more
* Power output might not match the workload
*   Usually an issue of a weak PSU. The components ask for more power, but don't get it.
* Software aspect
*   Drivers can make components run non-optimally
*   Programs may have built-in limits which the hardware is capable of surpassing
*       Some programs are single-threaded, and take longer to finish just beccause all cores but one are not doing anything
*   Configurations (especially BIOS/UEFI) which limit the parts' performance 



>> Connectors / Data Transfer Formats

> USB
+ Relevant for USB drives, USB-to-SATA adapters, Android file-transfer (and charging), video-feed (including streaming to a VR headset), and any external peripheral.
+ USB 4 (any gen) is only provided by USB-C
+ Some USB-C cables are merely supporting USB 2.0
+ When a USB-device supports a protocol, it's not inferred that it runs on it at full speed; it's just above the speed of previous tier.
* The confusing terminology:
~>  USB_version  Aliases                         Transfer-Rate(B/s)  Transfer-Rate(b/s)
~<  1.0          -                                         187 kB/s            1.5 Mb/s
~<  1.1          "Full-Speed"                              1.5 MB/s             12 Mb/s
~<  2.0          "High-Speed"                               60 MB/s            480 Mb/s
~<  3.x_Gen_1    "SuperSpeed"  (was: "USB 3.0")            625 MB/s              5 Gb/s
~<  3.x_Gen_2    "SuperSpeed+" (was: "USB 3.1")           1.25 GB/s             10 Gb/s
~<  3.2_Gen_2x2  -                                         2.5 GB/s             20 Gb/s
~<  4_Gen_3x2    -                                           5 GB/s             40 Gb/s
~<  4_Gen_4      "USB 4 V2.0"                               10 GB/s             80 Gb/s

> PCI
+ If for some reason you want to lower the PCI compatibility of your PCIe slots (maybe for testing, and considering moving your hardware to an older board), you can do so through your BIOS/UEFI menu.
* PCIe (PCI Express) connections have a different number of connectors (lanes): x1 / x2 / x4 / x8 / x16.
*   x2 isn't common. Sometimes M.2 has 2 lanes (though usually it's 4)
* PCI is universal and interchangeable: older-gen devices can use newer-gen slots, and newer-gen devices can use older-gen slots.
*   The performance is by the lowest of the two. If one is only Gen 3, it wouldn't matter that the other is Gen 5, they'll run at Gen 3 speeds.
*   You can use a slot with "too many" lanes for a device that connects to only a few of them. It'll work.
*   Most devices (including GPUs) would even work on too-few lanes!
*       if the PCIe header is close off at the end, blocking the rest of your device, you can really just cut-out the obstructing piece (carefully). Some motherboards have open-ended PCIe slots for this reason.
~>  Table: PCIe Transfer Speeds (in GB/s) ;
~>  PCIe_Generation      per-lane_(x1)  x2   x4  x8   x16
~<                  1.0           0.25  0.5   1    2    4
~<                  2.0            0.5    1   2    4    8
~<                  3.0              1    2   4    8   16
~<                  4.0              2    4   8   16   32
~<                  5.0              4    8  16   32   64
~<    6.0 (future-impl)              8   16  32   64  128
~<  7.0 (future-design)             16   32  64  128  256
+ Like in USB, each generation roughly doubles the transfer rate of previous generation
+   Like in USB, these are "max speeds" - the PCIe slots won't maximize the above-listed potential, but they should be above previous generation's promise

TODO - GDDR

> HDMI
+ HDMI is proprietary, owned by the HDMI Forum - a bunch of tech companies.
+   They exercise their power to disallow implementation of advanced features in Open-Source drivers (AMD asked, was denied - that's why there's no Linus suppor of FreeSync on HDMI, and you can't run 4K@120 on HDMI2.1 on Linux)
+ There's the Standard HDMI (Type A), Mini HDMI (Type C), and Micro HDMI (Type D). All have 19 pins and support the same performance
+   Type B is defined with 29 pins, but isn't used anywhere

>> SSD (flash) / Disk
+ "Solid State Drive" (solid meaning non-volatile) doesn't have to be Flash, but it usually is.
+ Be aware that unpowered SSDs should be stored in extreme temperatures (not above 30C and not freezing either) to avoid/slow-down data degradation over a year or two.

> SSD vs alternatives
* Intel's Optane (non-flash SSD), is discontinued (true to the time of writing this).
*+  Used to be slightly faster than Flash-SSD
*-  Used to be more expensive than Flash-SSD
* HDD is generally inferior; it's a slowly-dying technology. Avoid those. HDD's downsides:
*-  Longer data-retrieval/write time (slow)
*-  low tolerance to movement while operating
*-  bit-rot (magnetic flip of some bits after some time) requires rewriting the data!
*-  higher electricity consumption and heat
*-  larger physical space taken
*-  Device dies out faster
*       Especially Seagate's drives. From personal experience, and the experience of various acquaitences. Look up HDD failure graphs and you'll see them failing most; over twice as often as the next competitor.
*           HGST used to be the best HDD maker in terms of failure rates. Now it's WDC.
*+  Technically cheaper than SSD, by a factor of around 2.5.
*-      Expensive long-run: the flaws cost you money (electricity consumption, general cooling, rate of replacement, storage space, data maintenance)
*       Just get a Samsung 870 QVO (a QLC SSD) if you want cheap(ish) bulk-storage.
* Hybrid (part-HDD, part-SSD): a drive that tries to optimize save-location of files to either the SSD part or the HDD part, by the frequency of access to them
*-  You get most of the downsides of HDD, and not all advantages of SSD (yet all disadvantages of it). Just don't bother, get a full-SSD. 

> NVMe is better than SATA
+ Notice, on M.2 connections (or the SSD sticks) you can identify the supported protocol: 1 notch (hole on disk-drive, no bus) means it's NVMe, 2 notches means it's SATA
* NVMe is a protocol optimized for SSDs, and requires a PCIe connection
* M.2 is most common. There's also U.2 (mostly enterprise, it's rare in the consumer market), which looks a bit like SATA connection on the drives, though it works on NVMe.
* M.2 connections provide 4 PCI lanes (less often, only 2), their max transfer speeds; PCI Gen-3: 3940 MB/s , PCI Gen-4: 7880 MB/s. See the PCI topic for more details.

> SATA
+ SATA is both the physical interface and the protocol (not limited by interface; can use the M.2 header).
* SATA III's bandwidth caps at 600 GB/s
*   Notice that because of this, a USB 3.0 port (or better) can properly substitute a SATA port (with a proper adapter). It's even convenient, as you don't need to route power
*       You DO need to do power-cable routing if you want to run an HDD (generally: don't), since it needs the extra power for physical movement of the discs and head
* If storage-volume is by-far your first priority, it makes sense to buy 2.5" SATA SSD drives. It's very cost-effective.
* The largest volume SSDs are in SATA or U.2 form. SATA is the more common and affordable.

> E1.S / E3.S
* Enterprise PCIe connector that looks like M.2
* Will reach consumer market at some point (soon™. Current note from is 2024 Q1). Until this happens, there's no point to elaborate here

> USB
* USB drives are usually used as temporary/transfer-storage, or as an easily-carried backup. They usually have very simple controllers, not meant for constant operation with concurrent requests
*   You can use it for a few operating systems, notoriously Tails-OS which is built for privacy and content-ownership deniability
+ Taking the limitations of USB drives into consideration, you'd probably only value their volume (nowadays typically between 64GiB and 2TiB), and speed (refer to the USB section)

> NAND types
+ The number of bits in a cell determine how long it has to live. If any of the bits burns out, the whole cell is unusable.
* SLC (1 bit) single-level cell; will have the longest lifespan. No longer used for entire disks, only as cache. Estimated to last 100k cycles.
* MLC (2 bits) multi-level cell; no longer made. Estimated to last 3k-10k cycles.
* TLC (3 bits) tri-level cell; a common configuration for flash-SSDs, associated with V-NAND (3D-stacking) manufacturing. Estimated to last 500-3k cycles.
* QLC (4 bits) quad-level cell; these cells die more frequently, but the higher density fits well for storage (write once, read as many times as you want). Estimated to last 300-1k cycles.

> DRAM and cache
+ Great-performance drives should have both of those. Especially the dedicated DRAM.
* DRAM Buffer - space dedicated for a lookup-table (~0.1% of disk volume). Having a dedicated DRAM chip improves performance by a lot.
*   There are 2 types of dedicated DRAM buffers: a DRAM module on the drive (best), or SLC-cache storage. 
*   Without a dedicate DRAM buffer, the memorization of addresses within the SSD falls onto parts unfitting of the responsibility. Either:
*       the SSD's storage space (everything will be slower and the disk degrades faster)
*       your system's RAM (which creates accessibility and bandwidth/latency issues, especially during concurrent disk usages).
* Cache - a fast-retrieve space that accelerates read/write - you read from it faster, or make a fast write which gets transferred (slower) to the main storage.
*   Make sure it's SLC (single cell), i.e. dedicated. Not a direct write to the TLC.
*   If you want to read/write large files, make sure that the cache-buffer is large enough.
*   In case the SSD's storage space is used for DRAM/Cache, it'd degrade the storage space faster, require more free space on disk, and anyway the data there is slower-access which is counter-productive to the purpose of DRAM/Cache

> Brand
+ Notice that some brands add a "plus" to their models' names, and the throughput difference there could be multiple times more than non-plus version while only costing 10% more.
+ Note: There are 3 companies (not counting subsidiaries) that create DRAM: Samsung, Micron, SK Hynix. They also make NAND. It factors into the price and quality control.
* You should pick from a known reputable brand, they're not much more expensive than their smaller competitors, and they have better support (drivers/software)
*  Samsung [Flash/NAND manufacturer] - possibly the strongest SSD vendor, they have a lot of great products with good software
*  Micron [Flash/NAND manufacturer] - sells to other businesses B-to-B; the SSDs you can buy from them are at huge volumes (and accordingly expensive)
*  WD - a known company, but uses deceptive naming to sometimes sell inferior products using model names that sound more advanced; you need to check the specs carefully
*  Crucial (a subsidiary of Micron; mostly budget-oriented) - Should be mentioned that they allegedly "pulled an ADATA" trick, by stealthily downgrading the controller of their MX500 models 
*  SK Hynix [Flash/NAND manufacturer] - has some high-end drives
*  Sabrent
*  ADATA - be careful of them (buy only if there's a really good deal), as they quietly downgraded the quality of one of their models once, and also declared having a DRAM buffer on some models that didn't. Also some of their drives terribly underperformed despite having great specs listed.
*  Sandisk (bought out by WD) - mediocre at best. Did the same shady parts-swap trick as ADATA.



>> GPU

> Terminology 
* AMD GPU-naming:
*   [legacy] AMD CrossFire - no longer implemented; was a technology for sharing GPU-workload on multiple GPUs
*   XT: Basically means the same GPU but marginally clocked higher. TODO - verify this is consistently so
*   XTX
*   GRE (Golden Rabbit Edition): China-only release, now worldwide. Performance is between XT and XTX.
* NVIDIA GPU-naming:
+   Any prefix could have "GeForce" brand mentioned; it doesn't mean anything today (there's no more "Quadro" brand), just ignore it.
*   [legacy] NVIDIA SLI - no longer implemented; was a technology for sharing GPU-workload on multiple GPUs
*   [legacy] NVIDIA GS: lowest-end
*   [legacy] NVIDIA GT: mid-low range
*   [legacy] NVIDIA GTX: mid-high end (not anymore; today if it's not "RTX", it's low-end). X means it has NVIDIA's hardware video encoding, and 
*   NVIDIA RTX: any modern NVIDIA card. The "R" or "RT" stand for "Ray-Tracing" (a highly compute-demanding rendering technique that only became possible within recent decade with GPU's escalated power)
*   <model-name> Super: negligibly-slightly (1%-15%) better than base model
*   <model-name> Ti: marginally-to-astoundingly (10%-100%) better than base model. Could also mean extra VRAM.
*   <model-name> Ti Super: This should indicate that the Ti was at a moderate bump (20-25%), so the "super" adds extra 10% on top of the "Ti". Could also mean extra VRAM (over "Ti").
*   <model-name> D (Dragon): Chinese-market release. Basically the same model, maybe slightly weaker.
*   <model-name> FE: just means NVIDIA themselves are the vendors (see note about that in "Tiers")

TODO: DLSS 3, FSR 3, XeSS , Frame-Generation , Ray Reconstruction, DXR (DirectX Ray-Tracing)

> AMD cards pros/cons:
*+  As of the time of writing, AMD (Radeon) cards are the budget-oriented options; better overall performance/price. Maybe Intel would become as relevant in the future.
*+      AMD cards have more VRAM in mid-tiers, and often more cores. As their drivers get better, their full potential gets realized years after launch, making them great long-term picks
*+  Still as of current date, 2024 Q1, AMD is better for Linux (fewer issues of various sorts), though NVIDIA cards are perfectly workable
*+  Maybe you can run CUDA processes (such as AI) on your AMD card, with this:  https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA ; know that it's now against NVIDIA's updated ToS.
*+  AMD's old cards get significantly cheaper with time, and it's often the case that some newer generation cards are barely any better than some card in the previous series that's much cheaper. So check prices for previous series and buy the better deal overall.
*-  Drivers (especially early ones) are often reported as problematic, more than NVIDIA's

> NVIDIA cards pros/cons:
*+  If you want to use CUDA for AI, you'd have to pick NVIDIA
*+  If you want NVIDIA's "Ray Tracing" feature, you'd have to pick NVIDIA (AMD have their own, but it's not as developed)
*+  If you have a G-SYNC monitor, you can't make use of that feature (G-SYNC) unless you use an NVIDIA GPU
*-  NVIDIA's latest highest-end cards have voltage problems; there are numerous reports of their high-power requirement practically melting connections
*-  NVIDIA's old cards aren't dropping much in price, so if you're buying from them, you probably want something from the newest series. 

> Intel cards pros/cons:
*+  Sometimes available for low price, for their performance.
*-  Intel's drivers are still lacking, as does the hardware (has a lot of potential, which might not ever get materialized). Basically buying them is still a gamble, if not a mere novelty.
*-  Intel's cards are far behind AMD and NVIDIA in capabilities, for now.

> Heatsink styles
* There are 2 available styles: You can look at the heatsink's fin-orientation to tell which one it is:
*   "Blower" cooler: takes air from the case, through the whole length of the aluminium fins of its heatsink, and extracts it out at the back of the case, below the monitor-connection ports
*   "Open Air" cooler: takes air from the case, passing it perpendicular to the card's length, extracting it back into the case
*       Some old cards have a circular heatsink that still dumps heat back into its surroundings; it's still open-air design.
* Some cards have 2-sided cooling, as they specifically have memory modules are located at their back and are in need of extra cooling.
*   Most cards just have a metal-backplate which passively spreads the heat to more area within the case
* Fan area-size matters, so usually 3 fans are just better than 2 fans
* Heatsink-mass matters; more (=denser) metal grates means more surface-area to exchange the heat through
+ GPU-cooling is often a major bottleneck. So practically, "Open-Air" is the better (and more-commonly available) choice, as it's better at cooling it (the air I/O is better as there's more surface-area for it to leave through)
+   If your case has heating issues, or the extra-heat is problematic to the CPU or the voltage modules around it, maybe you'd prefer a blower-style

> Tiers
+ Accept 2-4% deviance expected performance; no card is the same, even if they're sold as the same model. Some would be a bit faster, some a bit slower. Some cards even perform better than instances of their slightly-upgraded model counterparts.
* Vaguely the tiers go like this:
*   low-tier: an (almost?) extinct tier of ~$100 cards, good enough to just-run AAA games on low-mid settings at 30-60 FPS.
*       Modern APUs are about on-par with 8-year-old low-tier GPUs
*       low-tier cards often require no extra power connections (they run just off the PCIe's power), and that makes them convenient to use in various situations, notably as upgrades for very-old computers
*   mid-tier: cards that can run AAA games well up to 1440p (a few years ago, the standard for mid was 1080p). These days, in the range of $300-$600
*   high-end: cards that run games at 4K, or render your 3D model projects and animations significantly faster than mid-tier. These days, in the range of $700-$1800
*       Realistically, this tier is needed for quality-VR experience
*       If you want to mine (GPU-based) Cryptocurrency, you basically need a card at this tier to have better value-per-watt (if you can have net gains at all...)
*       AI workloads require cards of the higher-end of this tier, especially considering that the bottleneck is the amount of VRAM and that AI mainly uses CUDA (which is NVIDIA's, who skimp on VRAM in mid-range)
+ If you just want to game with your GPU, remember that some gains are meaningless; there's very little difference in experience between 140 FPS and 180 FPS at the same quality (number of polygons and same visual effects)
*   A reasonable jump in capabilities is supposed to make gaming feasible on 1440p instead of 1080p, or 4K instead of 1440p. If you consider improving at hard-to-notice areas like between 90 and 96 FPS, just save your money.
*       You should have a margin of just 10-20% beyond what you consider a good experience at the quality-tier you're aiming for. Beyond that, yet below the next quality-tier, there's no point.
+ Generally, you shouldn't waste a lot of money on the "Gaming"/"OC" edition cards (basically for the brand's stylized although maybe-bit-better cooler). If you get into a 100-300 dollar difference that could get you a higher-tier card, just get the higher-tier one.
+ NVIDIA sells "FE" ("Founders' Edition") cards, which have their own (somewhat shitty) heatsink applied. Quality-wise, FE cards are usually high-binned, regularly at lower price; they're often a better deal than 3rd-party NVIDIA cards.
+   An especially-good choice if you want to replace the heatsink with a waterblock

> PCIe versions
+ Refer to PCI section
+ Reminder: not all PCIe slots connect directly to CPU (usually it's jut the top one), some go through chipset and thus have more latency. So put your card(s) in top-slot(s)
+ Usually the card is the limiting component. As of writing, 2024 Q1, the strongest GPU on the market ("RTX 4090") is PCI Gen 4, while many boards are already on PCI Gen 5.
* The "RTX 4090" (which is a PCI Gen 4 card) should display the worst discrepency between PCI generations since it's the strongest card. Within full-utilization for max FPS (bandwidth is the bottleneck):
*   performs the same on Gen 4 and 5
*   performs slightly lower in Gen 3:
*       4K (as it should be used):  up to 1% performance loss
*       1440p:                      up to 2% performance loss
*       1080p:                      up to 2% (typically), but possibly 10-25% performance loss in specific cases due to driver-optimization issues
+ In realistic scenarios, there's still no meaningful performance boost beyond PCI Gen 3. Even for the specific cases where you're lowering the resolution and expecting worse performance, your CPU and Monitor would likely limit you.



>> CPU
* As of the time of writing, AMD makes the best CPUs in both performance and efficiency.
* AMD's CPUs are now the more expensive option, especially when factoring how pricier their motherboard are over Intel's
TODO - focus on integrated graphics (APU)
TODO - G / X / K / KF GPUs.
TODO - P cores, E cores
TODO - value retention
TODO - intel being more efficient than Intel



>> RAM
> Terminology
* A desktop memory "stick" (or "card") is "DIMM". For laptop and most mini-PCs, it's "SO-DIMM".
*   The 2 are different in physical form. Make sure you buy the right one!
* MT vs MHz: There's a RAM misconception for DDR (Double Data Rate); Products are specified as X MHz but measure at X/2 MHz in diagnostic tools. That's because this X refers to M.Transfers, not M.Hertz, since DDR (being true to its name) performs 2 transfer operations per cycle.
* RAM has its own "split" in memory allocation - there's single-rank ("SR") and dual-rank ("DR"). Usually, but not always, a DR RAM card would have memory modules on both sides. and SR would only have them on one.
*   SR isn't putting as big a load on the memory controller.
* Memory controller is part of the CPU 
* Your RAM-speed is also limited by the CPU and motherboard. Putting a bigger load on the memory controller results in having lower max-frequencies

TODO - DDR comparison

> Timing: There are 4-5 different timings: CL-tRCD-tRP-tRAS-(maybe)CMD  # for more details, read: https://hardwaresecrets.com/understanding-ram-timings/
* CAS latency: "C" or "CL" or "Clock" is the most significant factor; num of cycles the memory controller takes to retrieve data
*   So the latency of RAM is: (CL * 2 / transfer_rate) instructions/s.  The result is in the order of 1/10^8 instructions/s, so latency is typically around 10 nanoseconds.
* RAS to CAS delay: "tRCD"; num of cycles it takes to access ready memory (time between "RAS"; row activation, and "CAS"; column activation in the data-matrix)
* RAS precharge: "tRP"; num of cycles between row reads (disabling access to one line, and beginning access to another line)
* Active to Precharge Delay: "tRAS"; minumum waiting-cycles a row (in data-matrix) has to go through until next memory access
* Command rate: "CMD"; Sometimes not announced. Usually 1 or 2 cycles, which the memory chip requires to get ready after activation

> Topologies: Your motherboard may have either of these RAM layouts:
* "1DPC" (1 dimm per channel; usually on boards with 2 RAM slots) - the CPU has 2 channels, and each is connected to one RAM slot
* "Daisy-Chain" (aka "fly-by") - slots from left to right 1,2 (typically "A1","A2") and 3,4 (typically "B1","B2") are daisy-chained together so the CPU accesses 2 with each channel
*   When using only 2 of the slots, prefer using A2 and B2 (each RAM stick gets a channel to the CPU), i.e. the ones further away from the CPU
*       Why A2, B2 and not A1, B1? For complicated electrical-engineering reasons (unknown to me)
*   If you only have one stick (not ideal), use A2.
* "T-topology" - the RAM slots are connected in pairs (like DaisyChain), but in parallel, so their distance to the CPU is the same. The bus-connections are at 90 degrees, which looks like "T"
*   The paths are longer than in Daisy chain, expect lower frequency than DaisyChain for 2 sticks
*   Less difference (if at all) between 2 RAM sticks and 4, due to the same-distances (bus-lengths) to CPU).
*       You should still use A2, B2 as is custom, though technically you can be weird and put 2 sticks in A1, B2 or A1, B1 or A2, B1 or A1, B2. You wouldn't even need to retrain (re-determine timings for frequency).
+ These topologies' performance also depends on how well they were implemented; You should unerstand their limitations, but also consider how much your vendor cares for quality.

> Buying / installing
* As of the beginning of 2024, DDR4 is already unsupported by latest AMD/Intel generations. It's on its way out. DDR5 is about 1.5 times faster than DDR4, and consumes less power.
* Don't mix different models of RAM - use multiple of the same kind of stick
* Use 2 or 4 sticks of RAM (just not an odd number) to avoid latency issues.
* Prefer 2 RAM sticks instead of 4 to lower the load on the memory controller (2x16 GB 3600MT will sometimes have better response rate than 4x8 GB 3600MT)
*   There *is* more bandwidth in using 4. It factors in at some niche workloads.
*   As mentioned, for 2 sticks, DaisyChain generally gets better frequencies
*   If you really want to use 4, you're slightly better-off doing it in T-topology motherboard
*       Generally, if it works out better for you (price or storage volume), just go for 4...
* You can ignore the QVL (qualified vendors list) of motherboards, RAM rarely works exclusively with the listed vendors.
* You can ignore the CPUs' and motherboards' listed compatible memory speeds - those are base-specs, not limits.
* Remember that motherboards typically run RAM at 2666 MHz by default. You need to enter BIOS/UEFI configuration (press DEL or some other key while booting) to specify the target intended speed through "XMP" or "EXPO". If your calibration fails, try slightly lower frequency (or different voltage if you know what you're doing)
*   You need to find how fast your RAM really goes (or more precisely, how well it's getting along with your MB and CPU) through trial and error. For you, it may end-up higher or lower than what's mentioned on the product's box.
* Repeating a past bullet to make it clear: the most important factor when buying RAM is the ratio of the frequency (desired higher) to Clock (desired lower)
*   Example: 3600MHz* at C18 is lesser to 3200MHz* at C14.   (*MT, not MHz, but store-pages will display them wrong, so I'm playing along...)
*   Example: 3600MHz* at C18 is about the same as 3200MHz* at C16. Generally, at equal frequency-to-clock ratios, the higher-frequency option is slightly better. (*see above remark)



>> Motherboard
> TODO: form factors ("EATX", ATX, Micro-ATX(mATX), Mini ITX)
TODO - air-flow, and fan sizes
TODO - refer to RAM in regards to topology
TODO - refer to PCI in regards to possible allocations
*   The top one (if not the only one) is usually x16, sometimes the only x16 on the board, and the only one connected to the CPU directly, so if you use a GPU, it should go there to maximize its bandwidth and performance
TODO - specify chipset: PCI lanes and which ones go to CPU or chipset
TODO - 3rd-party pressure plates for some types of CPU sockets, for even mounting



>> PSU
* PSUs are passive - they don't adjust the power that they deliver. Whatever the PC components ask for, they provide (if possible)
* DON'T use one brand's PSU's cable on another brand's PSU!

> Interface
* Modularity (mostly a matter of short-term convenience)
*   Modular: most convenient, you can avoid attaching unnecessary cables, or replace any of them
*   Semi-Modular: like modular, but Motherboard and CPU cables are permanently attached (but you'd need them attached eventually anyway)
*   Non-modular: No modularity, you get a clutter of cables attached. Could be an issue if your case has no space for all of the cables. Turns cable routing more tedious too.
* 12VHPWR connector - a 16-pin (12+4) connector in the ATX 3.0 standard (Not to be confused with Motherboard ATX form factor), delivering up to 600W. Basically just for (NVIDIA) GPUs.
*   GPUs with such a connector come with an adapter to 2-4 different 8-pin connectors; for older PSUs that don't have a 12VHPWR outlet.  
+   Make sure to fully-insert those, because loose contacts at such high power have been observed as fire-starters.

> Wattage needs
* PSUs are most efficient (min. amount of power-loss) at around 50% utility. Of-course it's also important that it's able to power the entire system (PC) on full-load 
* An old 1200W PSU is about as good and long-lasting as a modern-built one: computing evolves but physics doesn't; capacitors aren't built in much better quality than in the past
*   Unless Nvidia would change the basic-wattage-requirement perception again, and your once-overkill PSU would be relatively underpowered in modern standards
*   Generally buying a PSU that's "too good" in terms of wattage-supply is a good idea - you won't need to buy a new one for your next PC, and it'd save a bit on your electricity as it'd run closer to the mentioned 50% point.

> Fan
* Generally, FDB (Fluid Dynamic Bearing) are the best (rifling is on the inside).
*   Marketing lies about this, so there are no guarantees (where you get rifle bearings on the outside); the FDB patent's up and so no one's checking if the term is used right.
* Some PSUs come with "Eco Mode" which allows the fan to turn off when the PSU doesn't require the cooling
*   There are some risks with this mode (according to people's reports), so you should probably just avoid it, and leave your fan running non-stop.

> Desireable physical features (advanced stuff; you can skip this section)
* Japanese capacitors; those are the best.
*   There are some high-quality US and German, but they're rarely used for consumer-grade PSUs 
* AC-to-DC ("Primary"): AC power gets stepped-down with a transformer, then converted to unregulated DC via rectifier circuit.
* DC-to-DC ("Secondary"):
*   Switching Regulator Topology
+       Reading references: https://www.smps.us/topologies.html , https://www.ti.com/seclit/ml/sszp406/sszp406.pdf
+       There are many possible layouts for SMPS (Switching Mode Power Supply). Keeping it simple; LLC for high-end PSUs, Double-Forward for cheap PSUs.
*           Double Forward / 2-Switch Forward: Cheap, but causes coil whine and is inefficient.
*           Resonant LLC: 2 inductors (LL; one inductor is a transformer) and a capacitor (C). Expensive but efficient.
*               As Half-Bridge: the most common LLC; simpler, uses 2 switches. Can be optimal for lower wattage PSUs.
*               As Full-Bridge: uses 4 switches; more complicated and expensive, but also more efficient; great for high wattage. Not fitting for lower-power, like 750W (assuming that the parts are efficient)
*   Regulations
*       Group Regulated: poor regulation (voltages can go too high), cheap
*       DC-DC: Newest. Similar to Double Mag Amp, but more efficient (can function with less load). Most efficient and most expensive.

> Top Brands
* The best-by-quality PSU companies by descending order:
*   Seasonic
*   EVGA / Corsair
*   PC-case companies like Antec / be-quiet! / Cooler-Master / Fractal-Design
*   motherboard companies like MSi / ASUS
*   other known brands, such as XFX
*   Gigabyte - knowingly shipped power supplies that 

> Brands you should avoid
* Don't buy the following; Besides having to replace them sooner, your other more-expensive computer parts would be in danger:
*   Unknown brands
*       Aresgames [obscure brand] (Lied to become top PSU-seller in Amazon, for model "AGS850", claiming it was 80+ Gold, while it was 80+ Bronze at best)
*   Gigabyte (purposely shipped faulty PSUs in the past. Look up "exploding power supplies" and you'll see them mentioned first.)

> 80+
+ A measure of how much of the input (AC) gets converted to the output (DC)
+ There's a new alternative: "Cybernetics" - a standard of testing with a full report for each model
* Try to pick a PSU with a better 80+ certification of efficiency, to minimize power-loss.
*   This is just an efficiency-rating, don't think of it as a general-quality grade. It's not taking into accound some very importent things, like voltage regulation, or issues like ripple.
*   Be aware that this isn't monitored/enforced, and some companies have been caught lying about it

>> Air-coolers
+ Cheapest, simplest (reliable; not prone to breaking, but can be replaced easily regardless) cooling solution - air is conducted through the metal sitting on top of a component, which get vented by fan(s)
+ Rule of thumb: Metal mass determines cooling rate. The more metal and surface area, the better
+ Being a long-lasting product, a good cooler can serve you for many builds over the years. You can't argue with thermodynamics; products that were really good 10 years ago will still be good 10 years from now
+ Usually meant for CPU coolers; you wouldn't normally buy a GPU air-cooler because those always come bundled, and at better performance than stock CPUs' coolers (if any).
+   You can use a CPU-cooler on a GPU; it's quite effective. If you can mount it.
TODO - mention RAM clearance

> Heat-pipes
+ An important part in any large cooler; for quick heat-spread
+ Basically a copper tube with water-vapor within, which cools (condenses to liquid) at the end and comes back flowing on the walls
+ Generally, the more heat-pipes the better the heat-spread/conduction
* Theoretically, some patterned wall-linings can improve the flow, or separation between the vapors and liquids
*   Sintered - walls are coated by grainy/powdery material.
*   Grooved - walls are grooved like in a rifle's barrel, with about 30 parallel grooves.
*   Mesh Weave - weaved strands of copper lining the walls.

+ All of these are trailing behind the AIO coolers listed (in AIO section), but not by a lot from the bottom of the AIO list
+ These results are for specific wattage at a specific dBA noise limit (which affects each company's fans differently). The ranking changes over slight tweaks.
+   Nevertheless, this is roughly the order in which they should be ranked, and these are still the world's leading air-coolers; they're are all good.

>> AIO
+ "All-in-One"; Liquid cooling "in-a-can"; includes a water-block, a couple of soft tubes, a small pump and a radiator. Comes pre-filled with water

> Air-cooler similarities:
* Metal mass matters a lot; i.e. bigger size and density of radiator are make noticeable improvement.
* Almost always used on CPU, rather than GPU. Though you can (and maybe should), if you'll find a way to mount it to the GPU.
* Eventually dumps the heat onto the case's (and eventually room's) air, using fans

> Difference from air-coolers:
*-Not as long-lasting or easy to replace parts as air-coolers
*%Pricier, though superior at cooling
*   If you bought a very expensive CPU, you may as well use an AIO to realize the CPU's potential
*+Big radiators allow cooling at lower fan-spin, resulting in less noise
*-Doesn't cool the VRMs and mosfets near the CPU the way air-coolers do
*   Some AIOs have a fan embedded aat the water-block to solve this issue
*+No RAM-clearance issues

> Difference from custom liquid-cooling loop:
*+Not quite as good (naturally, since AIO has just one "medium-sized" radiator and a small pump)
*-Not nearly as much of a hassle or as expensive as custom.

> Tube typtes
* Rubber (could have braided externals) - flexible, but slight liquid loss over time
* Teflon - more rigid, much less liquid loss, but could crack

> Case-mounting
* Make sure your case can accomodate the radiator (usually that means cases with space for a 360mm radiator on top)
* The liquid inside isn't filled to 100%, and with time you'd accumulate more air within. That air can degrade the pump (pumps should not run on air, only liquid), so make sure that the pump isn't at the highest in the AIO
*   If your pump is on the water-block (most common), your radiator should be at the top of the case, or to the side (front-intake) with part of it being higher than the CPU
*       If you put the radiator to the side, the tubes should connect to the top part of the ratidator, to allow the escape of air from the CPU-block
*   If your pump is embedded in the radiator, either put the radiator at the bottom of the case (if there's air-intake there), or vertically while pump area is at the bottom.

# Not discussing how things work; only the effects of used technologies

> Type of LCD panel; Almost all monitors are made of LCD, lit by LEDs. The LCD is arranged in one of the following 3 configurations
* IPS (In-Plane Switching): Good colors and angles, most common type as of this writing
* VA (Vertical alignment; basically IPS but different crystal orientation): Similar to IPS, slightly better in some aspects
* TN (Twisted Nematic): Worst at most (especially at color display), but has better refresh/response time (though the gap has been largely narrowed). Often the cheapest option.
+ There's also OLED, which has "true black" (since it's self-illuminating, no extra backpanel illumination) and is growing in popularity over LCD types. OLED oxidises and experiences burn-ins (localized heating issues), so its lifespan is generally shorter than LED.
+ Future technology: Micro-(O)Led. Can be assembled at much higher density and survives longer than OLED. For now it still has "ghosting" issues (previous frames still being visible, can make a "smearing" effect)
+   Mini-LED is a transitionary technology. Just bigger (worse) MicroLED.

> Response time
* 5 ms response should be the most you accept at this point
* 1 ms is the high standard and is becoming very common

> Frequency
* 60Hz is the standard garbage-extra-monitor. You can easily see which frames your monitor couldn't draw your mouse at.
* 120Hz / 144Hz is a noticeable improvement over 60
* 240 is about the best you can find but is still largely a TN-screen niche

> Resolution
+ You should already know what resolution you're after (and remember that your computer requires a certain amount of power to drive the according amount of pixels)
+ There's 720p and 1366x768 ("WXGA HD"), but they're not worth looking into. 1080p is already a low bar at this age.
* "1080p": 1920x1080 ("Full HD"). You can call it "1K".
*   same category: 1920x1200 ("WUXGA"), and the x2 wider: 2560x1080
* "1440p": 2560x1440 ("QHD" / "WQHD"). You can call it "2K"
*   same category: 3440x1440 ("Ultra Wide QHD"/"UWQHD"), and the x2 wider: 5120x1440 ("Dual QHD")
* "4K": 3840x2160 ("4K UHD")
*   same category: the wider 5120x2160
* "5K": 5120x2880 ("5K UHD")
* "8K": 7680x4320 ("8K UHD")

> HDR (color vibrance adjustment/improvement)
* HDR 400: 400 nits of brightness; 8-bit colors (sRGB). Considered garbage quality, but it's still HDR...
* HDR 10: 10-bit colors (Wide color gamut). A group of types that forms the vast majority of displays. If a monitor is just mentioned as "HDR 10", assume it's of the lowest quality of this group.
* HDR 600: 600 nits of brightness; 10-bit colors
* HDR 1000: 1000 nits of brightness; 10-bit colors. The high-standard of quality HDR with noticable improvement over the lesser options
* HDR 1600: 1600 nits of brightness; 10-bit colors.

> Freesync/G-sync
* G-SYNC ("True GSYNC", NOT "GSYNC-Compatible") means that unlike Freesync, there's an actual processor within the screen that does 2-way communication with the video card 
* Some great monitors don't have G-SYNC, but having G-SYNC is an assurance of a great monitor 

> Brands
* LG's highest-quality line of products: "UltraGear"
* Acer's highest-quality line of products: "Predator"
* ASUS's highest-quality line of products: "ROG Strix"



* TODO - Keyboards (including mechanical switches (specifically Cherry MX, also Gateron and Akko), keys' material: PBT keys vs ABS keys, Topre electrostatic switches)
    Switches' resistence: if they're light at the start and heavy at the end, they feel "mushy" (generally a bad thing). They should be Linear.
    Make sure that the switches fit into the plate (what kind of square hole do they have) 
    models for example: HHKB Pro 1, Leopold FC660C,  Duck Octagon V3, OrtholinearKeyboards Planck (usues Neutrino plate), Tofu96, IQUNIX F96 Knight

* TODO - Mice

* TODO - headphones



>> Game-controllers

> Gulikit has good magnetic-sticks controllers.
* Their most famous controller is the "KingKong2 Pro", which handles like the official Nintendo Switch's "Pro Controller"
*   Has swappable thumb-buttons (XBOX or other console configuration), Amiibo reader, rumble, motion (orientation) sensor, and recordable/repeatable input
*   Some of those come with buttons that start to squeak or get stuck, requiring a full teardown for oiling/greasing the keys' switches
*   The buttons feel like MX Blue or Brown, very clicky. Supposedly rotating the switches' housing by 90 degrees would cause the bump to be ignored, acting more like MX Red
* Their later model, KK3 Max, is basically the same as the KingKong2 Pro, with some upgrades
*   Includes a downgrade: regular/cheap silicone membrane instead of switches. Those could tear over time. But at least they won't get squeaky or stuck.
*   Has 4 optional back-peddals that allow extra inputs.
*   Not sure if previous models were this good at recording, but the playback has exact stick vectors (usually not the case in controllers' playback) 

> 8bitdo - Nintendo-styled controllers of various sizes and looks



* TODO - UPS (on-line and not, longevity, wattage according to PSU...)





TODO?
DAC + AMP (and maybe speakers)
VR
PCIe: NIC (Intel vs Realtek), sound, USB, ...
UPS
