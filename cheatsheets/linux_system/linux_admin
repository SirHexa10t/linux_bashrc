# Reminders for linux system tools and command options
+ Also check packages in "gui" and "cli" cheatsheets



>> RUN
* reboot                        # reboots the system (gracefully)
* sudo systemctl start sshd     # start ssh service for external access
* sudo service apache2 restart  # restart apache service (if any)


>> Package Management (Debian)
* apt search <term>  # look for substring in known packages. As usual, nala can also be used
* sudo apt install/remove/purge <package>  # package install/remove/remove-including-configs
* sudo gdebi -n <package.deb>  # probably the best way there is to install a .deb file (the `-n` is for "no prompt")
* dpkg -l  # show all installed packages in table format
* sudo dpkg -r <package>  # remove a package installed from a .deb file
* sudo dpkg --purge <package>  # purge a package installed from a .deb file
* dpkg-query --list <package>  # print info related to installed package (autocompletes the name), works for all installations including from .deb
* apt list  # list all packages in followed repositories
*   apt list --installed  # list installed packages
*   dpkg -l  # show all installed packages in table format


>> Firmware updates
* Using "fwupdmgr" package
*  fwupdmgr get-devices  # get list of updateable devices
*  fwupdmgr refresh  # download metadata
*  fwupdmgr update  # get updates
+ Some vendors don't provide updates through fwupdmgr, you might be able to download an iso-updater, as demonstrated here for Samsung SSDs:
+  https://blog.quindorian.org/2021/05/firmware-update-samsung-ssd-in-linux.html/


>> filesystem
* ln -s <existing_file_to_link> <link_name>  # define soft-link. There are 2 symlink types; soft (denoted with -s, which points to a file's address) and hard (points directly to the data of a file. Editing the data in either "original" or hard-link is the same, and deleting either file alone wouldn't delete the data since it's still pointed to)
+   soft links don't really utilize permissions - they allow everything and rely on the target to determine access. chmodding a symlink would forward the modification to the target. 
*   ln -sr scripts/*.js target/  # create soft-links for all .js files in "scripts/", in "target/" (target/[filename.js] -> scripts/[filename.js]) 
* cd  # change directory to specified folder. Write no directory to return to home-dir - Equivalent to `cd ~`
*   cd -  # go back to previous directory
* less <file>  # Read file with up/down controls. Newer and more convenient than `more`.
* diff <file1> <file2>  # get the text difference between 2 files


>> Network
> Own network info
* ip addr               # display own networking interfaces. A modern safer alternative to: ifconfig
* sudo netstat -tulpn   # display active network connections and filter by port number
> Seeking addresses
* dig "amazon.com" +short   # resolve dns address (or addresses, in case content-distribution-networks are involved)
* ping google.com           # ping address


>> Internet Queries
* wget <url>  # download files
* curl <url>  # communicate through HTTP(S)/(S)FTP/SCP - make any request (but if you just want to download something, you should probably use `wget`)
 

>> Firewall
* ufw allow 21115:21119/tcp  # change firewall rules (by ports or src address) - in this case, allow ports 21115 to 21119 (including) on tcp
* sudo tcpdump -i any -n  # capture traffic on all networks for all ports
* sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -n "src host <external_IP> and dst port <dst_port>"  # detailed monitoring
*   detailed monitoring example 1:  `sudo tcpdump -i enp5s0 -n "dst port 21118"`
*   detailed monitoring example 2:  `sudo tcpdump -i any -n "tcp and (dst port 21115 or dst port 21116 or dst port 21117 or dst port 21118 or dst port 21119)"`
*   detailed monitoring example 3:  `sudo tcpdump -i any src 46.120.97.16 -nn -c 20`  # -nn shows ip addresses and port-num without resolving hostname, -c stops capturing after 20 packets


>> Users / Groups
* groups <username>                                         # display the groups of a user
* usermod -aG <groupA,groupB,groupC> <username>             # add user to group(s). You can even add to group sudo (makes into superuser in Ubuntu).
* getent group                                              # list all groups and their user-members
* sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" <username>    # adduser is a useradd wrapper (addused is generally better). The `--disabled-password` and `--gecos` options are required for no-prompt; `--disabled-password` skips password creation and disables password login. `--gecos` fills thumbnail info (cancels interactive). `--no-create-home` skips homedir creation.
*   sudo adduser <username> --gecos "" --disabled-password && echo "<username>:<password>" | sudo chpasswd  # Add user with password in one line. Be sure to specify the username twice, as needed here
* sudo deluser --remove-home <username>                     # delete user and associate homedir
* su - <username>  # Switch to user. Might require sudo.
* visudo  # edit the /etc/sudoers file (only if you know what you are doing)


>> configurations
* /etc/default/grub  :  boot configurations
*   update-grub2  # updates grub for you (comments out old grub configurations).
+   if you want to setup a new boot partition for (U)EFI, you can just create at the start of your disk a new FAT32 partition with 300MB-1GB storage and boot-flag, using "gparted" (recommended through a live-boot usb-stick). Then run boot-repair (installation: `sudo apt install -y boot-repair`) and update-grub2. Rerun update-grub2 on your actual OS to overwrite the resulting listed "Ubuntu" grub.
* /etc/ufw/ufw.conf                 :  UFW (firewall) config-file
*   /var/log/ufw.log                :  UFW outputs file. To monitor incoming requests, `sudo tail` this file after setting config "LOGLEVEL=debug", applied with `sudo ufw reload` (no-interruption reset; if it won't work run: `sudo service ufw restart`)
* /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf  :  blacklist modules, such as firmware
* /etc/fstab  :  mounting configurations, including for dir "/"
* /etc/environment  :  OS environment variables
*   printenv  # print (all) current environment variables
* /etc/sudoers  :  sudo users file
* sudo nvidia-xconfig  # create new xorg config, used by nvidia driver


>> Configurations (GNOME)
* ~/.config/autostart/  :  location of startup scripts that run for your own user after startup 
* ~/Templates/  :  anything you put in this folder will be a new-file template when you right-click in nemo


>> Configurations (Nemo file-manager)
* ~/.local/share/nemo/scripts/  :  anything you put in this folder will be an executable-script available when you right-click in nemo
* ~/.local/share/nemo/actions/  :  config files you put in this folder will be available as actions when you right-click in nemo (immediately within the menu, not in a submenu like the scripts)


>> Logs
+ to tail a logfile in real-time run: "tail -f <logfile>", or to get last 100 lines: "tail -100 <logfile>"
* /var/log/boot.log  :  System boot log
* /var/log/syslog  :  System-events log (like connection of a USB device)
* /var/log/auth.log  :  Login-attempts log
* /var/log/dmesg  :  log for kernel ring buffer
*   dmesg -k | grep -E "warn|error"  # dmesg displays kernel logs buffer
* /var/log/kern.log  :  log for kernel ring buffer
* /var/log/btmp  :  also could be "wtmp"; it's a binary file for login/logout events, and it can't be read directly
*   last  # read binary log of login/logout events. Use "lastb" (like so: `sudo lastb -adF` ) to only read bad events.
* journalctl  # inspect systemd logs (like so: `journalctl -u <service-name>`, you can add -f to follow)
