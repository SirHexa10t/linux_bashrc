# A collection of neat/useful programs and tools.
# TODO - write which package managers are most reliable for the following packages


>> GUI / Visual
>> ============

> Process Manager
* GNOME System Monitor  : Graphs for CPU, RAM, Network. Also storage% utilization and current proccesses (much like Windows' "Task Manager"), but there are better tools for those. 
* xkill                 # after you run this, your mouse cursor would turn into an "x" sign, and the next window youll click would be killed. A bit lazy and silly.

> File Manager
* Nemo                  :  (gtk) GNOME-based file manager. Started as a fork of Nautilus.

> Resource Management
* gnome-disks-utility (built on UDisks)     :  display drives' info and (optionally) mount/dismount in dir "/media/<username>/"
* GParted                                   :  partition management

> Editor / viewer
* LibreOffice                               :  Microsoft Office documents
* OnlyOffice                                :  Microsoft Office documents (looks exactly like Microsoft's)
* xreader [github.com/linuxmint/xreader]    :  documents, including PDF
* xviewer [github.com/linuxmint/xviewer]    :  images/pictures
* Visual Studio Code                        :  Text Editor
* Sublime Text                              :  Text Editor
* Xed [github.com/linuxmint/xed]            :  Text Editor
* Kate                                      :  Text Editor

> Browser / web-service client
* Brave         :  Chromium-based privacy-oriented browser
* LibreWolf     :  firefox-based privacy-oriented browser
* Thunderbird   :  email-client
    # TODO - check if better than GMail web-client
* Signal        :  chat/phone app
* Telegram      :  chat/phone app

> Device integration
* scrcpy                        # run daemon that casts the connected Android device screen onto a window, and shares the clicks within it back to the Android device
*   scrcpy -r <filename.mp4>    # save a video recording of your connected android device activity (needs USB-Debug and File-Transfer mode)

> Media Player
* celluloid [formerly mpv]  :  videos
* Hypnotix                  :  IPTV streaming

> Desktop Sharing
* OBS-Studio    :  screen sharing
* RustDesk      :  screen sharing

> Boredom
* oneko &  # Summon a small cat that chases after your mouse. You can get many of those concurrently, and there's also a version with a dog (read the man page).

> Packages of interest (didn't look into them properly yet; TODO)
* FireDragon (browser)
* Ranger (terminal-based file-manager, Python-based)
* Krusader (file-manager)
* Yazi [https://yazi-rs.github.io] (terminal-based file-manager, better than ranger?)
* Vieb ( )
* Thunar                :  (gtk) does dual-window layout and remembers your last location
* Dolphin               :  (qt) KDE-based file manager


>> CLI / Tools
>> ===========
+ Some of these tools may be pre-installed in your distro, but they're still not part of "clean" Linux. For default-tools, check the linux-admin cheatsheet

> Packages
* nala      :  apt, but better

> Processes
* htop      #  real-time process monitor
* btop      #  htop-like, but with slightly less focus on processes; an overview of the system, including CPU-core temps, and network-usage

> Disks
* ldmtool                   :  Read dynamic disks by running `sudo ldmtool create all`, and then mounting with `mount -t ntfs /dev/mapper/<volume_name>`
* wipefs -a /dev/<sd??>     # remove filesystem data; removes RAID metadata
* udisksctl mount --block-device=/dev/<device-name>  # Mount a device the way nemo would. No need for mkdir (and nemo can dismount it right), no harm in calling while unnecessary, automatically uses LABEL to mount at "/media/<username>/"
*   udisksctl mount --block-device=/dev/<device-name> 2> /dev/null

> media (pdf) editors
* pdftk
*  pdftk <file.pdf> input_pw <password> output <fileout.pdf>                # save pdf copy without password
*  pdftk <file1.pdf> <file2.pdf> <file3.pdf> cat output <merged_name.pdf>   # create a unified pdf file
* xournal
*  xournal <pdf_filepath>                                                   # edit a pdf file with option to add signatures

> media (images/video) editors
* ffmpeg  # general media (image / audio / video) handling package, you can find some usages/examples in the custom_bashrc script

> Microsoft formatting and proprietary system (Windows) stuff
* lnkinfo <lnk-file>        # display link info
* dos2unix <file>           # convert files from windows to unix encoding
* sudo ntfsfix <device> -v  # run check-disk on NTFS device
* ldmtool                   #  Read "dynamic disks" by running `sudo ldmtool create all`, and then mounting with `mount -t ntfs /dev/mapper/<volume_name>`

> Terminal-purposed web services
* curl "wttr.in"    # get an ascii weather report

> Boredom
* fortune  # get a "fortune". needs package: fortune-mod
*   watch fortune  # get new fortune text every 2 seconds

> Visual Appeal (making other people bored)
* asciiaquarium  # Run ascii aquarium. Has some interactivity with hotkeys)

> ASCII (Boredom?)
+ Create ASCII writings in this site: http://patorjk.com/software/taag/
* figlet <text>  # write ASCII styled text, different fonts are also supported
* banner <text>  # write ASCII styled text
* toilet <text>  # write ASCII styled text, different fonts and styles are also supported
* jp2a --output=<output.txt> --colors <input.png>   # convert image to ASCII
* ascii-image-converter <input.png>                 # convert image to ASCII
* lolcat                                            # rainbow-color text
*   <text_output_command> | lolcat
* pv                                                # "pipe viewer" - not the main usage, but you can make it write text progressively (like being typed, or (if fast) etched by a laser engraver)
*   <text_output_command> | pv -qL 200              # Apply pv to some text. Try testing with `neofetch`. Try adding pipe to `lolcat`.

> Text To Speech
* espeak <text>  # read-out (audio) the given text. A bit of a gimmick, sounds very robotic
