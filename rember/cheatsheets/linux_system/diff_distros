# Notable Linux distros and their origin + usecase

>> Distros:
+ Basically there are 3 primary groups of desktop distros (which use different package managers): Debian (apt), Arch (pacman), Fedora (dnf)
*   Some distros come with specially-made UI and customization options, and of-course the maintainers (and their servers) differ too

# TODO - reformat the lines

>> Debian
Debian - operating simplicity. Has a large community and common program support/compatibility. Debian itself isn't (or just wasn't?) easy to install.
    Ubuntu - user-friendly, basic/beginner experience on GNOME
        Mint - customized with a lot of tools and a few distinct systems, mainly used with Cinnamon (GNOME based)
        Pop!OS - like mint, stylized on its own, made by a laptop seller
        Tuxedo OS - great KDE system ("best KDE distro I ever saw" -The Linux Experiment), made by a laptop seller
        Elementary OS - stylish. Mouse (non-terminal) oriented. Requires recent hardware and at-least medium-spec hardware. Runs its own unique Desktop Environment that's in many ways like Mac
        Zorin OS - comes with some common software like Mint (and a bit beyond). Updates rather slow, every 2 years
        Kubuntu - flavor rather than distro; running on KDE Plasma (instead of GNOME)
        Lubuntu - flavor rather than distro; runinng on LXQt (instead of GNOME). Very lightwedight 
        Xubuntu - flavor rather than distro; runinng on Xfce (instead of GNOME). Very lightwedight 
    Deepin (formerly "Hiweed") - Chinese distro with telemetry, based on old Debian version
    SteamOS 1 / 2 - a game library/player
    Kali - basically a network and penetration-testing platform
    Parrot - same as Kali but less bloated
    Tails - Security/privacy-focused OS that runs off of a USB drive, and doesn't persist information
    Raspberry Pi OS - runs RaspberryPi devices


>> Red Hat
+ stable; business-oriented. Incorporates "SELinux" - Security Enhanced Linux developed by Red Hat and used by the NSA, which has a complicated user-access system.
    Fedora - Highly polished, just works. Solid choice in most ways. Linus Tovalds's choice!
        QubesOS - privacy-focused; everything is in its own VM. Touted as the best for security by Edward Snowden.
        Nobara - Gaming-oriented (shortens a bit some simple steps you'd have to do in Fedora), with some slight improvements in performance over Fedora. No SELinux.
    CentOS - stability/security-focused (on expense of updates). Used often on servers
    RHEL - Enterprise Linux, used often on servers. NOT free.


>> Arch
Arch - Custom-tailored, meant to be personally-configured and run the latest software. Less bloat, as it's meant to run specifically with your hardware. Updates often, known to be less stable
    EndeavourOS - possibly the best Arch distro, according to someone on youtube. It's close to vanilla-Arch, with some slight tweaks.
    Garuda - use-friendly and polished with pre-selected programs and features. Includes a gaming-specific flavor.
    Manjaro - (was) relatively-convenient Arch; it detects your hardware and installs the necessary drivers for you. But they're not updating their certificates properly, and replaced open-source software with proprietary, and used alpha/beta version of apps as "stable". And some packages on AUR break Manjaro due to versioning. The focus is higher on stability (over bleeding-edge) than other Arch OSs, but that's probably your focus if you go for Arch.
    Arco Linux - similar to Manjaro?
        Big Linux - has a lot of convenient GUI configurations, and an easy way to switch the Desktop Environment
    SteamOS 3 - Steam Deck's OS, used for gaming, runs with KDE Plasma 5 and has a Windows-compatibility layer
        HoloISO - SteamOS, adapted to run on Desktop (naturally for gaming)

>> Enoch
    Gentoo - Like Arch but somehow more extreme. You have to compile everything yourself. Absolute minimalism and specialization, a good choice for a vending machine or a restaurant's menu.
        Chromium OS - for people who don't want a computer, just Google Chrome


>> Alpine
Alpine - very light and minimalistic (supports run-from-RAM), great for microservices and dockerized server stuff


>> SuSE Linux 
+ "Software- und System-Entwicklung" (Software and Systems Development)
    OpenSUSE Tumbleweed - rolling versions, but still stable. Can switch flavors easily! Has some GUI admin-tools that other distros don't have. OpenSUSE is meant for IT and productivity (comes with preinstallations)
    OpenSUSE Leap - Enterprise-focuse. Slower than Tumbleweed.


>> NixOS
NixOS - supports a lot of packages, has a reproducible-build system - writing packages and upgrade in specs, and you can go to previous versions if something broke. The Nix package manager is available for other distros.


>> Android
    LineageOS - a privacy-centered fork of CyanogenMod



Meant to run on media attachments. Lightweight
    Porteus - Works off SD/DVD/USB... Light and fast
    Puppy - Works off SD/DVD/USB...
    Tails (already mentioned above)


Linux From Scratch - a project that takes you through creation and customization of your own Linux OS.


OpenBSD/FreeBSD isn't Linux, but it's still Unix-like. Entirely free and highly secure (network security).

Horizon (Nintendo Switch OS) - Derivative of "Nintendo 3DS system software", but has parts from FreeBSD's code, and Android elements

LatticeOS - I don't know which distro it forks from. Lightweight system with convenient docker-exported Restful APIs. Used in some drones.



Desktop Environments / flavors: 
Remember that those can be swapped; those are just system configurations / packages

    Qt-based:
        KDE (Neon) - Entirely free-software based. Stylish/modern and highly modifiable. Has a large (well-made) applications bundle. [Kool Desktop Environment]
            KDE Plasma - Has a lot of flare to it.
            KDE Lite - ?
        LXDE - a barebones lightweight environment
        LXQt - lightweight fork of LXDE, (about twice heavier the LXDE). Negligibly lighter than Xfce; relatively new (for better/worse). Looks like an amalgamation of old Windows and Mac, seems to have its own quirks
        Qtile - ?

    GTK(+)-based: (GTK 3)
        GNOME - Very common, but the progression from GNOME 2 to GNOME 3 (a bit more Mac-like) was controvertial.
            Cinnamon - Stylized, but still decently snappy. A fork of GNOME 3 but the layout is like GNOME 2 (Windows-7 like).
            MATE - Lighter than Cinnamon. The primary continuation of GNOME 2. Looks like Windows Vista.
        Xfce - Minimal on features and with crude graphics, works for weak or old hardware. Looks like flat Windows XP [abbreviation: XForms Common Environment]
        Pantheon - ?
        Unity - used to be the environment of Ubuntu, but they're long-gone
        Budgie - ?

    i3 - keyboard-only window manager
        TODO - see what it's based on
    DWM - another window manager (just terminal windows)
    
    DDE (Desktop Deepin Environment) - all I know is that it's a "beautiful" environment, maybe the best at that.
    i3WM - ?
    Wayfire - ?
    Awesome - ?
    Xmonad
    BSPWM
    

Visuals:
GTK - open source toolkits and GUI elements. Everything uses it.
Qt - a cross platform (for every common OS) GUI creator  [pronounced "cute"]
X11 - a display server. Extremely common, very old, somewhat bloated.
Wayland - a display server newer and lighter than X11. Many programs still don't support it. Accepts laptop trackpad gestures.


File Managers:
Nautilus - built on GNOME 2
Nemo - A fork of Nautilus
Caja - A fork of Nautilus
Dolphin - built on KDE
Terminal (tiling-ish) file managers:
    Midnight Commander (mc) - the same kind of look and control you get in old BIOS menus
    Ranger - vim-like, with file-preview functionality
    Last Files (lf) - a mimic of Ranger with a few extra features; written in Go
    CFiles Fast Terminal - similar to Ranger
    Vi File Manager (vifm) - similar to Ranger, but with 2 panes like mc
    Last File Manager (lfm) - like mc but more colorful; written in Python 3.4
    Nnn - very fast and lightweight
    TMux - session-based, with options to split into panes differently in each session
    Sway - i3 but meant to be used with Wayland
    Hyperland - fast-moving Wayland tiling manager



Meme distros:
AmogOS (among us, unknown to me what it forks off)
Ubuntu Satanic Edition (satanic Ubuntu, comes with free Metal music)
Moebuntu (moe Ubuntu. Anime styled)
Uwuntu (UwU Ubuntu. Anime styled)
Suicide Linux (Debian-based? incorrect commands get translated to "rm -rf /")
Red Star OS (North Korea's OS, unknown to me what it forks off. An opressive malware OS)
