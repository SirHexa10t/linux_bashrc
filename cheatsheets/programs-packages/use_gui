# A collection of neat/useful programs.
# TODO - write which package managers are most reliable for the following packages
+ Many of the programs are provided with Linux Mint


>> Process Manager
* GNOME System Monitor  # Graphs for CPU, RAM, Network. Also storage% utilization and current proccesses (much like Windows' "Task Manager"), but there are better tools for those. 
* xkill                 # after you run this, your mouse cursor would turn into an "x" sign, and the next window youll click would be killed. A bit lazy and silly.


>> File Manager
* Nemo                  # GNOME-based window-manager


>> Resource Management
* gnome-disks-utility (built on UDisks)     :  display drives' info and (optionally) mount/dismount in dir "/media/"
