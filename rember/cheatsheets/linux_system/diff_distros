# Notable Linux distros and their origin + usecase

>> Distros:
+ A version of Linux (could be a branch of a branch of a branch...) with its own Release Cycle
+ Basically there are 3 primary groups of desktop distros (which use different package managers): Debian (apt), Arch (pacman), Fedora (dnf)
*   Some distros come with specially-made UI and customization options, and of-course the maintainers (and their servers) differ too

> Debian
* Debian - operating simplicity. Has a large community and common program support/compatibility. Debian itself isn't (or just wasn't?) easy to install.
*   Ubuntu - user-friendly, basic/beginner experience on GNOME
*       Mint - customized with a lot of tools and a few distinct systems, mainly used with Cinnamon (GNOME based)
*       Pop!OS - like mint, stylized on its own, made by a laptop seller
*       Tuxedo OS - great KDE system ("best KDE distro I ever saw" -The Linux Experiment), made by a laptop seller
*       Elementary OS - stylish. Mouse (non-terminal) oriented. Requires recent hardware and at-least medium-spec hardware. Runs its own unique Desktop Environment that's in many ways like Mac
*       Zorin OS - comes with some common software like Mint (and a bit beyond). Updates rather slow, every 2 years
*       Kubuntu - flavor rather than distro; running on KDE Plasma (instead of GNOME)
*       Lubuntu - flavor rather than distro; runinng on LXQt (instead of GNOME). Very lightwedight 
*       Xubuntu - flavor rather than distro; runinng on Xfce (instead of GNOME). Very lightwedight 
*   Deepin (formerly "Hiweed") - Chinese distro with telemetry, based on old Debian version
*   SteamOS 1 / 2 - a game library/player
*   Kali - basically a network and penetration-testing platform
*   Parrot - same as Kali but less bloated
*   Tails - Security/privacy-focused OS that runs off of a USB drive, and doesn't persist information
*   Raspberry Pi OS - runs RaspberryPi devices

> Red Hat
+ stable; business-oriented. Incorporates "SELinux" - Security Enhanced Linux developed by Red Hat and used by the NSA, which has a complicated user-access system.
* Fedora - Highly polished, just works. Solid choice in most ways. Linus Tovalds's choice!
*   QubesOS - privacy-focused; everything is in its own VM. Touted as the best for security by Edward Snowden.
*   Nobara - Gaming-oriented (shortens a bit some simple steps you'd have to do in Fedora), with some slight improvements in performance over Fedora. No SELinux.
* CentOS - stability/security-focused (on expense of updates). Used often on servers
* RHEL - Enterprise Linux, used often on servers. NOT free.

> Arch
* Arch - Custom-tailored, meant to be personally-configured and run the latest software. Less bloat, as it's meant to run specifically with your hardware. Updates often, known to be less stable
*   EndeavourOS - possibly the best Arch distro, according to someone on youtube. It's close to vanilla-Arch, with some slight tweaks.
*   Garuda - use-friendly and polished with pre-selected programs and features. Includes a gaming-specific flavor.
*   Manjaro - (was) relatively-convenient Arch; it detects your hardware and installs the necessary drivers for you. But they're not updating their certificates properly, and replaced open-source software with proprietary, and used alpha/beta version of apps as "stable". And some packages on AUR break Manjaro due to versioning. The focus is higher on stability (over bleeding-edge) than other Arch OSs, but that's probably your focus if you go for Arch.
*   Arco Linux - similar to Manjaro?
*       Big Linux - has a lot of convenient GUI configurations, and an easy way to switch the Desktop Environment
*   SteamOS 3 - Steam Deck's OS, used for gaming, runs with KDE Plasma 5 and has a Windows-compatibility layer
*       HoloISO - SteamOS, adapted to run on Desktop (naturally for gaming)

> Enoch
* Gentoo - Like Arch but somehow more extreme. You have to compile everything yourself. Absolute minimalism and specialization, a good choice for a vending machine or a restaurant's menu.
*   Chromium OS - for people who don't want a computer, just Google Chrome

> Alpine
* Alpine - very light and minimalistic (supports run-from-RAM), great for microservices and dockerized server stuff

> SuSE Linux 
+ "Software- und System-Entwicklung" (Software and Systems Development) [pronounced "suza"]
* OpenSUSE Tumbleweed - rolling versions, but still stable. Can switch flavors easily! Has some GUI admin-tools that other distros don't have. OpenSUSE is meant for IT and productivity (comes with preinstallations)
* OpenSUSE Leap - Enterprise-focuse. Slower than Tumbleweed.

> NixOS
* NixOS - supports a lot of packages, has a reproducible-build system - writing packages and upgrade in specs, and you can go to previous versions if something broke. The Nix package manager is available for other distros.

> Android
* Android - a mobile-device OS mainly maintained and developed by Google
*   LineageOS - a privacy-centered fork of CyanogenMod

> OSs meant to run on media attachments; lightweight
* Porteus - Works off SD/DVD/USB... Light and fast
* Puppy - Works off SD/DVD/USB...
* Tails (already mentioned above)

> Linux From Scratch
+ a project that takes you through creation and customization of your own Linux OS.

> LatticeOS
+ I don't know which distro it forks from. Lightweight system with convenient docker-exported Restful APIs. Used in some drones.

> Meme distros:
* AmogOS (among us, unknown to me what it forks off)
* Ubuntu Satanic Edition (satanic Ubuntu, comes with free Metal music)
* Moebuntu (moe Ubuntu. Anime styled)
* Uwuntu (UwU Ubuntu. Anime styled)
* Suicide Linux (Debian-based? incorrect commands get translated to "rm -rf /")
* Red Star OS (North Korea's OS, unknown to me what it forks off. An opressive malware OS)



>> Non-Linux, but almost (Unix/Unix-like)

> OpenBSD/FreeBSD
+ isn't Linux, but it's still Unix-like. Entirely free and highly secure (network security).

> Horizon (Nintendo Switch OS)
+ Derivative of "Nintendo 3DS system software", but has parts from FreeBSD's code, and Android elements



>> GUI toolkit
* Qt - a cross platform (including for Windows) GUI creator  [pronounced "cute"]
* GTK+ - open source toolkits, common in Unix-like systems. Used to write Desktop Environments but not Window-managers(?)



>> Display Servers
* X11 - a display server. Extremely common, very old, somewhat bloated.
* Wayland - a display server newer and lighter than X11. Many programs still don't support it. Notably, accepts laptop trackpad gestures.



>> Window-manager
+ The main visual component of a Desktop Environment (if included). Determines display of windows, screen-interaction, effects like snapping and tiling, GUI elements like the taskbar... 
+ Many Window Managers are also Compositors, meaning they interact with Xorg/wlroots to handle device (keyboard/mouse) I/O

> Tiling Managers
+ https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Comparison_of_tiling_window_managers
+ Keyboard-driven managers that fill your screen with your windows without overlaps.
+   Some tiling features are implemented in non-tiling managers
* Usually the most lightweight (few resources to run)
* Types:
*   Manual tiler: you tell the next window where to open (to either of the 4 sides of current window)
*   Dynamic tiler: each new window opens according to a layout-pattern you define
* Examples:
*   i3 - keyboard-only window manager  # TODO - see what it's based on
*       Sway - i3 but meant to be used with Wayland
*   DWM - another window manager (just terminal windows)
*   Awesome - can be used in tiling / floating mode, can use Wayland
*   Xmonad - ?
*   Hyperland - uses Wayland
*   BSPWM - uses Wayland
*   Wayfire - uses Wayland
*   Mosaic - uses Wayland
*   Qtile - Qt-based
*   River - ?
*   Cutefish - ?

> Stacking Managers
* KWin - KDE Plasma implementation that uses Wayland
* Mutter - GNOME Shell that uses Wayland



>> Desktop Environments / flavors: 
+ Desktop environment is a complete interface that consists of a Window Manager, File Manager, Applications, Themes...
+ Flavors are variants of pre-configured distro-installations. Basically further-tweaked/personalized (if at all) Desktop Environments
+ Remember that those can be swapped; they're just system configurations / packages

> Qt-based:
* KDE (Neon) - Entirely free-software based. Stylish/modern and highly modifiable. Has a large (well-made) applications bundle. [Kool Desktop Environment]
*   KDE Plasma - Has a lot of flare to it.
*   KDE Lite - ?
* LXDE (discontinued) - a barebones lightweight environment
*   LXQt - lightweight fork of LXDE, (about twice heavier the LXDE). Negligibly lighter than Xfce; relatively new (for better/worse). Looks like an amalgamation of old Windows and Mac, seems to have its own quirks
* DDE (Desktop Deepin Environment) - a "beautiful" environment, maybe the best at that.

> GTK(+)-based: (GTK 3)
* GNOME - Very common, but the progression from GNOME 2 to GNOME 3 (a bit more Mac-like) was controvertial.
*   Cinnamon - Stylized, but still decently snappy. A fork of GNOME 3 but the layout is like GNOME 2 (Windows-7 like).
*   MATE - Lighter than Cinnamon. The primary continuation of GNOME 2. Looks like Windows Vista.
*   Budgie - used in Solus, featuring a modern and customizable interface
* Xfce - Minimal on features and with crude graphics, works for weak or old hardware. Looks like flat Windows XP [abbreviation: XForms Common Environment]
* Pantheon - used in elementary OS, simple/user-friendly
* Unity (discontinued) - used to be the environment of Ubuntu, but they're long-gone



>> File Managers

> Graphical
* Nautilus - started on GNOME 2, evolved since 
* Nemo - A fork of Nautilus
* Caja - A fork of Nautilus
* Dolphin - built on KDE, for KDE Plasma

> Terminal-based
* Midnight Commander (mc) - the same kind of look and control you get in old BIOS menus
* Ranger - vim-like, with file-preview functionality
* Last Files (lf) - a mimic of Ranger with a few extra features; written in Go
* CFiles Fast Terminal - similar to Ranger
* Vi File Manager (vifm) - similar to Ranger, but with 2 panes like mc
* Last File Manager (lfm) - like mc but more colorful; written in Python 3.4
* Nnn - very fast and lightweight

> honorable-mention:
* TMux - basically the experience of a terminal-based file-manager, in a package. It's session-based, with options to split into panes differently in each session
