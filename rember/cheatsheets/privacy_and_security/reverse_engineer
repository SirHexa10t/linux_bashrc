# Reminders how to approach sketchy executables



>> Disassembly
* IDA (Interactive DisAssembler)
* Ghidra    : a very commonly used NSA tool  [ https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra  ,   ]
* dotPeek   : .NET decompiler and Asm browswer from JetBrains 



>> Services
* "https://any.run"  : test-run executables



>> Scanning / diagnostic tools/packages
* strings <my_executable.exe> | less  # list used strings. See if any URLs are being used.
* objdump -d -Minterl <program_file>  # using Intel syntax, describe the program as a list of assembly instructions
* checksec --file=<file_to_check> --output=json | jq  # check which security features (if any) are active for the specified file, for things like buffer overflow
