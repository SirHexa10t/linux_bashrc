# A compilation of resources and techniques for learning Japanese
+ Thanks to modern AI, it should be easier than ever to get advice and clarifications when needed (though some things are still a matter of culture, which only real humans would know)
+ Using the language is generally great for learning; you can do that by having a pen-pal (anyone you could talk to on the internet), watching Japanese videos, playing Japanese games, reading manga


TODO - differences between Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji
Hiragana-only is problematic, as words blend together due to Japanese's lack of spacing (it's like reading English without spaces)



>> Interactive Japanese

> Computer Games
* "Learn Japanese to Survive": https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/7746/Learn_Japanese_To_Survive_Trilogy/
*   recommended by a couple of people who were quite fluent in reading/writing
*   You can often get the whole pack for a couple of dollars on Fanatical.com
* "Learn Japanese RPG: Hiragana Forbidden Speech":  https://store.steampowered.com/app/1114950/Learn_Japanese_RPG_Hiragana_Forbidden_Speech/
*   not sure about it, but it seems similar to "Learn Japanese to Survive"



>> Tools and Apps
+ Remember that some very convenient tools are plain browser "extensions"/"plugins"/"add-ons"
* Anki - "flash cards" app: memorization cards, sorted into various categories and adapted for the user
*   AnkiDroid - Anki on Android
* Migaku - paid service that uses Anki
* Duolingo - a paid/commercials language-learning app that teaches basic sentences and common words
*   Can be helpful to understand the mechanics of the language, but not necessarily internalize/intuit them
*   Controvertial; various people claim it's a really bad tool
*       especially now that they removed the community discussions
*       Duolingo removed many Kanji, so you have to read a clumped mess of Hiragana
*   Some people consider it a "supplement"



>> Vocabulary

> Goal-posts
* Curve of word frequency in VNs: https://youtu.be/MYVeyIECCHI?si=AlDT6pDAzNsBFO9f&t=201
    * To understand 75% of the used words you need to know the 1000 most basic words
    * To understand 95% of the used words you need to know the 6000 most basic words
    * To understand 97.5% of the used words you need to know the 10,000 most basic words
    * To understand 99.x% of the used words you need to know the 20,000 most basic words
    * To understand ~100% of the used words you need to know 35,000 words
    + The maker of the linked video says that at a vocabulary of 16,000 words, the main issue with Japanese was too many unknwon words
