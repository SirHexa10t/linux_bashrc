# main indicatives for lying and manipulative behaviour. Also naturally includes motivation.

+ Motivation and manipulation have a huge overlap.
+ Understanding the involved psychological elements is non-trivial
+ You should distrust your own emotions / gut-feeling - those are very common and easy manipulation backdoors
 


>> Bad liers' habits/behavior
* Talking a lot - increased risk of undermining the consistency of the lies with contradicting hints/pieces of information
   * Making a lot of statements
* Have a disconnect with body-language (body-language gives a different impression than the verbal message)
   * body language could show confidence, but voice could show inconfidence
* Lots of movements when on a hot-seat
   * Can't make eye contact, shifting around



>> Proficient lying

> Proficient liers' behavior:
* Talk little
   * Ask a lot of questions
* Mirrors the postures/body-language of the other side 

> 4 basic human motivations
+ Ordered by efficiency, but the common acronym is RICE.
* Idealogoy     -  incentive based on morality relating to religion/country/friends/family/...
   * People would usually voluntarily disclose their idealogies
   * People react to emotionally-charged messages
* Ego           -  a personality-backdoor through the way people view themselves (in the sense of a personal identity, not as pop-culture associates it)
* Reward        -  things that you could want; promised to the manipulated person
* Coercion      -  forced push to action based on guilt/shame/blackmail...

> Making others behave or believe
+ Connecting what the other person cares about with what the manipulator wants them to do
   + Connects to RICE. "Do this for the good of your country/family/health..."



>> Body Mirroring
* people who're engaged in a talk mimic each-other's postures (hands, sitting position, etc.)
   * mirroring inspires the feeling of trust



>> Misconceptions

> Micro-expressions
+ You need a "baseline" to know what a person is like. You can't assume any of the following is irregular for a person you just met
* Eye-movement indicatives - You can analyze people's eye-movement, but there are many factors that can cause any behavior, it doesn't really say much.
* Amount of blinking
* Face twitching
* Sucking on lips 



>> Marketing
+ Naturally, marketing is manipulative

> SADRAT
* Spot          - find a potential target/client/agent
* Asses         - determine if manipulation-target is good/productive for the cause
* Develop
* Recruit       - have the manipulation-target sold on the idea/product
* hAndle
* Terminate



>> Espionage / Spying

> 3 types of lives / masks
+ Getting secrets out of people involves switching from Public to Secret lives
+ People are inclined to want to share secrets; share the burden, not be alone in this aspect. Doing so is a matter of trust
* Public    - default outward appearance
* Private   - person's nature around closest people. Knowing sensitivities: personal preferences, faults, opinions...
* Secret    - dark bits of info one doesn't share with anyone

> Raised likelihood of telling secrets
* To a trusted person
* To a person that provides/provided help
* To a person that shared their own secret (a form of mirroring). Requires the right amount of mirroring; opening a "window" rather than a "door"
*   Opening a door: a whole topic change. Might not be followed by the other side.
*   Opening a window: a small sideline hint that doesn't change the topic, but can be resumed by the other side later as a door. Should be relevant to the listener, for empathy

> Volunteering information
* 2 questions, 1 confirmation; to get the other side to feel like the manipulator "really cares" and "gets it" (because of the confirmations) and "is there to help" (because of the questions).
+   Asking a question in current topic (likely to be confirmed), asking a follow-up question (would also be confirmed), making a statement that confirms what's being said (so it wouldn't feel like an interrogation)
*   This process gets repeated in a cycle

> Perspective on people with shared secrets
* Naturally a person that has one's secret is viewed as rare
   * This, plus maybe sunken-cost-fallacy means that the trusted can remain in that status even after proving undeserving (lying/cheating/ultirier-motives-exposed/...)
