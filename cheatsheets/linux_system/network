# Reminders for network management
>> Own network info
* ip addr  # display own networking interfaces. A modern safer alternative to: ifconfig
* sudo netstat -tulpn  # display active network connections and filter by port number
>> Seeking addresses
* dig "amazon.com" +short  # resolve dns address (or addresses, in case content-distribution-networks are involved)
* ping google.com  # ping address
>> Firewall and incoming requests
* UFW config-file: /etc/ufw/ufw.conf  :  to monitor incoming requests, set in it: LOGLEVEL=debug , then run `sudo ufw reload` (no-interruption reset; if it won't work run: `sudo service ufw restart`), and then `sudo tail -f /var/log/ufw.log` to monitor
* ufw allow 21115:21119/tcp  # change firewall rules (by ports or src address) - in this case, allow ports 21115 to 21119 (including) on tcp
* sudo tcpdump -i any -n  # capture traffic on all networks for all ports
* sudo tcpdump -i <interface> -n "src host <external_IP> and dst port <dst_port>"  # detailed monitoring
*   detailed monitoring example 1:  `sudo tcpdump -i enp5s0 -n "dst port 21118"`
*   detailed monitoring example 2:  `sudo tcpdump -i any -n "tcp and (dst port 21115 or dst port 21116 or dst port 21117 or dst port 21118 or dst port 21119)"`
*   detailed monitoring example 3:  `sudo tcpdump -i any src 46.120.97.16 -nn -c 20`  # -nn shows ip addresses and port-num without resolving hostname, -c stops capturing after 20 packets
