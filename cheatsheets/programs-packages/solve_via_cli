# A collection of neat/useful tools/commands.
# TODO - write which package managers are most reliable for the following packages


>> Packages
* nala      :  apt, but better


>> Processes
* htop      #  real-time process monitor
* btop      #  htop-like, but with slightly less focus on processes; an overview of the system, including CPU-core temps, and network-usage


>> Disks
* ldmtool                   :  Read dynamic disks by running `sudo ldmtool create all`, and then mounting with `mount -t ntfs /dev/mapper/<volume_name>`
* wipefs -a /dev/<sd??>     # remove filesystem data; removes RAID metadata


>> Network
> Own network info
* ip addr               # display own networking interfaces. A modern safer alternative to: ifconfig
* sudo netstat -tulpn   # display active network connections and filter by port number

> Seeking addresses
* dig "amazon.com" +short   # resolve dns address (or addresses, in case content-distribution-networks are involved)
* ping google.com           # ping address


>> media (pdf) editors
* pdftk
*  pdftk <file.pdf> input_pw <password> output <fileout.pdf>                # save pdf copy without password
*  pdftk <file1.pdf> <file2.pdf> <file3.pdf> cat output <merged_name.pdf>   # create a unified pdf file
* xournal
*  xournal <pdf_filepath>                                                   # edit a pdf file with option to add signatures


>> media (images/video) editors
* ffmpeg  # general media (image / audio / video) handling package, you can find some usages/examples in the custom_bashrc script


>> Microsoft formatting and proprietary system (Windows) stuff
* lnkinfo <lnk-file>        # display link info
* dos2unix <file>           # convert files from windows to unix encoding
* sudo ntfsfix <device> -v  # run check-disk on NTFS device
* ldmtool                   #  Read "dynamic disks" by running `sudo ldmtool create all`, and then mounting with `mount -t ntfs /dev/mapper/<volume_name>`


>> Terminal-purposed web services
* curl "wttr.in"    # get an ascii weather report


>> Boredom
* furtune  # get a "fortune". needs package: fortune-mod
*   watch fortune  # get new fortune text every 2 seconds


>> ASCII (Boredom?)
+ Create ASCII writings in this site: http://patorjk.com/software/taag/
* figlet <text>  # write ASCII styled text, different fonts are also supported
* banner <text>  # write ASCII styled text
* toilet <text>  # write ASCII styled text, different fonts and styles are also supported
* jp2a --output=<output.txt> --colors <input.png>   # convert image to ASCII
* ascii-image-converter <input.png>                 # convert image to ASCII
* lolcat                                            # rainbow-color text
*   <text_output_command> | lolcat
* pv                                                # "pipe viewer" - not the main usage, but you can make it write text progressively (like being typed, or (if fast) etched by a laser engraver)
*   <text_output_command> | pv -qL 200              # Apply pv to some text. Try testing with `neofetch`. Try adding pipe to `lolcat`.
