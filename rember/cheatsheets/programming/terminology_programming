# terms that can make explanations shorter and should be common-programmers' understanding


>> High-level terms
>> ================

> Determinism
*   output is always the same for the same input



>> Functions
>> =========

> Side-effects
*   Alteration/modification of any data outside of function's scope, including usage of I/O devices, and including the args given
*   Output might depend on something other than input
*   (Generally bad)

> Pure Function
*   Deterministic
*   No side-effects
*   (Can exist "on their own", without external dependencies - this makes testing and usage simpler)
+ Example: `foo(x): return x+1` is pure.
+ Counter-example: `print("hello")` isn't pure (nor is any function containing such line)
