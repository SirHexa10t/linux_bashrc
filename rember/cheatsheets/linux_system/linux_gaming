# various things that might interest you if you want to game on Linux

  + General note: if you're gaming on Linux, you shouldn't run your games on NTFS (file system). This ancient MS file-system introduces various issues that you wouldn't want to deal with.
      + Since NTFS is proprietary, Linux probably won't resolve its compatibility issues with it anytime soon (or ever)
      + You can store your mods on ext4 for cross-compatibility with Windows machines



>> Hardware and Video Drivers

> GPU drivers
  * Nvidia cards: You should install the proprietary NVIDIA GPU drivers.
      * https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NVIDIA
  * AMD's default Open Source drivers are usually enough.
      * https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AMDGPU
      * Some programs (like DaVinci Resolve) require proprietary drivers, for which you'll need to install AMDGPU-PRO
  * Intel GPUs and Intel integrated-graphics work without intervention (no GPU drivers required)

> External GPU tools
  * GreenWithEnvy   : NVIDIA-GPU monitoring, fan-control, overclocking tool
      * https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gwe

> OS optimizations
  + Refer to Platform-Tools section

> For laptops (battery considerations)
  * SlimbookBattery     : override battery conservation, fan-control, and determine various batter/power-related thresholds
      * https://github.com/Slimbook-Team/slimbookbattery



>> Linux-native Games

> Compatible Engines (no need for porting / modifications)
  * Unreal Engine       : usually runs faster on Linux than Windows
  * Unity
      * Basically most of the indie games, right there. Though some will probably migrate to Unreal after their outrageous fee updates in 2023 
  * Godot
  * others: Lumberyard, Defold, GameMaker Studio, CRYENGINE, IdTech...
  
> Almost anything written in cross-platform languages
  * Java (if exceptional dependencies weren't included)
      * notably Minecraft
  * Python
      * notably Ren'Py (Visual Novel engine) games



>> Console Emulators

  + Almost all emulators are compatible with Linux
  + Many emulators can be found here: https://www.consoleroms.com/emulators
  + You can find many emulators on FlatHub
  
  TODO - separate into categories of what's emulated
  * There are many emulators, a few of them:
      * RetroArch         : an "emulators hub"; interface for different engines for different consoles
      * EmulationStation  : another "all in one" emulator
          * https://es-de.org/
          * Can stream to TV
          * Actively helps you import your roms into your Steam library, with cover-arts, descriptions etc.! 
      * Dolphin           : GameCube/Wii emulator
      * Play!             : PS2 emulator
      * TODO - RetroArch, Dosbox, PPSSPP, RPCS3, VMBA-M, FS-UAE, Higan, DeSmuME, KegaFusion, Waydroid, MAME, Citra (RIP), PCSX2, mGBA, FCEUX, DGEN, ZSNES, Mednafen, EmulationStation, ScummVM, Ryujinx, ePSXe, Stella, Reicast, Nestopia, Mupen64plus, Yabause, Pegasus, Yuzu (Rip)PCSX-R, Xemu, Hatari(?) DuckStation, Snes9X, SameBoy... (many more)



>> Running Windows-only Games

  + The most problematic games to run are those that have anti-cheat
      + Some Anti-Cheat games work (like FallGuys), but some don't (like Fortnite)
      + Generally you shouldn't try to play anti-cheat games on Linux; even if you're successful, they might ban you. Getting fucked with their kernel-level malware is just mandatory.
  + Even if you don't use Proton, there are useful community discussion over issues per-game on ProtonDB
  + You can also find compatibility notes and patches on WINE's site:  https://appdb.winehq.org/

> Packages and services
  + WINE and Proton come with Steam. You might need ProtonGE for some games, or Protontricks for some tuning. ProtonUp could help too
  * "WINE"        : "Wine Is Not (an) Emulator" - a compatibility-layer that translates Windows commands to Linux's (basically an emulator)
      * WINE-GE   : required(?) by ProtonGE, works on non-Steam games too   https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/wine-ge-custom
      * Bottles   : a UI for setting up and configuring WINE. You make profiles with presets of enabled features, like DirectX versions, FSR/DLSS, duscrete-GPU, Windows version compatibility...
  * "Proton"      : comes with built-in WINE to act as a compatibility layer, uses DXVK/VKD3D for translation of DirectX to Vulkan, and creates a virtual install-dir per-game. Developed by Valve and CodeWeavers.
      * "ProtonDB"      : https://www.protondb.com/  - check here what proton-compatibility has been verified for your Windows-game
      * "Protontricks"  : get a convenient interface to do Winetricks tuning per game
      * "ProtonGE"      : a port of Proton with specific games' patches   https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom
            * installed in: .steam/steam/compatibilitytools.d ; just put the proton-ge file there (usually latest version is best) and it'll be added into Steam's proton-list
      * Anti-Cheat workarounds: you can play around with the Proton versions, like installing while compatibility is set to 7-15, but launch the game with compatibility 7-21.
      + Usually you should pick the latest that's non-experimental
  * "ProtonUp" (CLI, or "ProtonUp-Qt" for GUI)  : an aid for installing ProtonGE (adding it to your list of Proton options), and other compatibility layers (listed below)
      * https://davidotek.github.io/protonup-qt/
  * "Winetricks"  : WINE settings and DLL compatibility tunings
      * https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.Matoking.protontricks
  * "Boxtron"     : basically DOSbox
  * "Luxtorpeda"  : open-source engines (games like Doom)
  * "Roberta"     : ScummVM

> Game Launchers/Libraries (GUI)
  * Steam   : just like in Windows. Works with most other tools, so you'd probably want it installed.
      * https://flathub.org/apps/com.valvesoftware.Steam
      * Thanks to the efforts of the Steam deck, Steam nowadays comes bundled with Proton, and convenient tweaking options.
      * To modify a game's Proton profile: right-click > "Properties..." > "COMPATIBILITY" > "Force the use of a specific steam Play compatibility tool" > choose an appropriate Proton version
      + You can run any program, not just games; that includes console emulators
  * Lutris  : gaming platform/manager game-launcher that bridges to other platforms (including ones with no Linux client at all). Requires Steam and Proton.
      * https://lutris.net/downloads    https://linux-gaming.kwindu.eu/index.php?title=Lutris
      * bridges to all major platforms; Steam, Epic, GOG, Humble-Bundle, Ubisoft Connect, Origin (EA), probably also itch.io. For Battle.net (Blizzard), you'll install the client in Lutris, then run and use it like in Windows.
      * has extra parameters for running, such as core-count restriction, or enabling "Feral GameMode" (which is just GameMode, refer to Platform-tools)
      * has community-maintained install-scripts for setup/configuration of WINE. There's a convenient button for adding games: "Search the Lutris website for installers".
          * Some games are problematic through this approach; you might want to just use "bottles" or "gamehub"
  * Heroic  : game launcher that serves as a replacement for the "Epic" client. You login to your EpicGames account and it'll list your games and give you launching options.
      * Better than the Epic client, and mostly better than Lutris
      * Also supports GOG account
  * GameHub : another game-launching hub, similar to Lutris; meant to unite your game libraries (GOG, Steam, HumbleBundle, itch-io...)
      + https://tkashkin.github.io/projects/gamehub/
      * Proton-version choice similar to Steam's
      * Has support for controllers
TODO - cover itch and minigalaxy

> Modding games
  * Steam Tinker Launch    : automates the modding process for games by handing you the tools you need, such as
      * Vortex Mod-manager  : Bethesda (only?) game modder
      * Hedgemod            : modder for Sonic games, from Generations up to latest (Frontiers)

  * TODO - others (too many to list all... mods for Monster Hunter, Risk of Rain, PayDay2, Tales of <anything>ia, Nier, ... )
  + Some modding tools were specifically Windows-only, but now work on Linux too!



>> Steam / Platform Tools

> Basic Steam steps:
  * Make your library display all games (including Windows') and allow running them:  Steam > Settings > Compatibility > [Enable everything]
  * Enable controller: Steam > Settings > Controller > [adjust according to your needs]
  * To modify a game's Proton profile: right-click > "Properties..." > "COMPATIBILITY" > "Force the use of a specific steam Play compatibility tool" > choose an appropriate Proton version
  
> Drivers and Hardware-acceleration
  * FSR: cross-platform (any manufacturer's GPU) upscaling program from AMD; if a game doesn't run in your monitor's resolution, you can run it lower resolution and upscale it
    * You can use it on Steam through ProtonGE by choosing it in compatibility list and then adding launch-option: "WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1 %command%" 
    * You can use it on Lutris by right-click on a game > "Runner options" -> toggle "Enable AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)"
    * You can use it on Heroic through the Wine section, by choosing GE-Proton and checking "Enable FSR Hack"

> Runtime monitoring (framerates, temps, etc.)
  * MangoHUD  : all the stats you could want at the corner of your screen
      * Install the tool in Steam and then refer to it per game: right-click > "Properties..." > "GENERAL" >  "LAUNCH OPTIONS": write (w/o quotes) "mangohud %command%"
  * Goverlay  : convenient configuration for MangoHUD and other tools
      * has global-apply options that'd save you the hassle of configuring all games' launch-options for hud-layout config
  * GameMode  : a daemon that applies optimizations to your games (GPU governor, I/O priority, process niceness...). Basically tells your computer to prioritize the game.
      * https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode
      * Install on Steam and then per game: right-click > "Properties..." > "GENERAL" >  "LAUNCH OPTIONS": write (w/o quotes) "gamemode %command%"
  * VkBASALT  : post-processing layer that improves games' graphics
TODO - cover SteamTinkerLauncher, DXVK, Gamescope, VR-video-player, Replay-Sorcery



>> Gaming-oriented Linux

> Flavors/distros
  + Technically you don't need a specialized system, but some of them come pre-configured and loaded with relevant apps to help you. Many people just game on Fedora
  * Nobara                          : (Fedora distro) Gaming-oriented (shortens a bit some simple steps you'd have to do in Fedora), with very-slight improvements in performance over Fedora. No SELinux.
  * Garuda Linux Dragonized Gaming  : (Arch distro)   A lot of flare; a heavy OS. Comes with a lot of gaming-oriented (translation-layer) packages and tools pre-installed.
  * SteamOS 3 (Arch distro)         : (Arch distro)   Steam Deck's OS, incorporates KDE Plasma 5.
      * HoloISO                     : (Arch distro)   SteamOS, adapted to run on Desktop
  
> Specialized Kernels (at your own risk)
  + https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel
  
  * for Arch
      * Zen Kernel - highly optimized low-latency kernel
  * for Debian
      * Zen Kernel
      * XanMod Kernel - memory management improvements
  * for Fedora
      * kernel-fsync - adds in various kinds of patches, including Steam-Deck support
