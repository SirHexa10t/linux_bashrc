# Reminders for the basic gimmicks of tmux terminal
tmux offers split-panes and sessions for terminals.
>> Good for managing a server:
+ tmux terminals persist even after disconnection. They keep running until restart the server or send a closure command.
+ tmux windows can be named, listed and looked up.
+ tmux can accomodate multiple users on the same terminal simultanously; good for assistance/collaboration and for doing jobs that need a "lock" (having a channel where certain jobs run, so people would know if someone elses job is underway and should be allowed to finish first)
>> Quick explanation: tmux has sessions. Each session can have various windows, each window (has a number and name) is a "screen" thats visible at the moment and has vertically/horizontally added panes 
+ For simplicity you can just have a SINGLE SESSION and manage all your windows there. Its easier to navigate windows, thanks to the green bar listing them at the bottom.
+ If a window has only need for a SINGLE TERMINAL (lets say the window is called "grub_config"), you can keep it simple and avoid adding extra panes. Add panes to multi-faceted things, like a project which has code, git-management, assets, runtime area etc.
